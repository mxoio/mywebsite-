        <h1>Privacy Policy for mxioi.uk</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 6, 2025</p> <p>This Privacy Policy describes how mxioi.uk ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with the operation of this website, which is hosted on GitHub Pages and utilizes services from Cloudflare.</p>

        <p>This website is primarily a static informational site displaying a countdown and related content. We aim to collect minimal personal data.</p>

        <h2>Information We Process via Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We rely on third-party services to host and operate this website. These services may collect certain information as part of their standard operations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>GitHub Pages (Hosting):</strong> This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub may collect standard server log information, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and timestamps when you access the site. This information is typically used for security monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing site usage trends. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cloudflare (DNS & Security):</strong> We use Cloudflare for DNS resolution and potentially for security services like Turnstile.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloudflare processes DNS queries made when your browser looks up our domain name.</li>
                    <li>If Cloudflare Turnstile is active, it collects minimal, non-intrusive data necessary to distinguish between human users and automated bots, primarily for security purposes. According to Cloudflare, Turnstile avoids using tracking cookies or harvesting sensitive device data.</li>
                    <li>Cloudflare may collect log data related to traffic routing and security events.</li>
                </ul>
                 For more details on Cloudflare's data practices, please see the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a> and information about <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turnstile</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>This website itself does not set any non-essential cookies. However, our service providers (GitHub or Cloudflare) might use essential cookies required for security, network management, or basic functionality. For example, Cloudflare may place a strictly necessary cookie for managing security rules or Turnstile functionality.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Any information collected by our third-party providers (GitHub, Cloudflare) is primarily used by them for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating, maintaining, and securing the hosting and network infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Providing DNS resolution and security services (like bot detection via Turnstile).</li>
            <li>Monitoring website traffic for performance and security analysis (usually in aggregated or anonymized forms).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not directly access or process raw personal data collected by these providers beyond potentially viewing aggregated statistics.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or rent personal information. Data collected by GitHub and Cloudflare is subject to their respective privacy policies regarding sharing.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We rely on the security measures implemented by GitHub and Cloudflare to protect the infrastructure hosting this website and the data they process.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location (e.g., UK/EEA), you may have rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or request deletion of data held by the service providers. Please refer to the privacy policies of GitHub and Cloudflare for information on how to exercise your rights with them.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
